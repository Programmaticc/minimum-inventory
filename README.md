# minimum-inventory
This project consists of Python scripts that reformat Excel tables and then calculate the minimum inventory levels based on the past sales volumes of the respective products. These scripts provide a minimum stock level that can be directly integrated into the inventory management system. This project was developed as part of a three-week internship.
